                    <h2>About Technology</h2> 
                        <p>In essence, technology combines art and science. Building a human-world involves the use of industrial organization and science.
                            The Oxford Dictionary defines technology as;<br>
                            
                            1. The practical application of scientific knowledge, particularly in business.<br>
                            2. Equipment and gadgets created with scientific knowledge.<br>
                            3. The field of study that focuses on engineering or applied sciences.<br>
                            When someone is asked, "What is technology?" they frequently respond with phrases like "machine," "science," and so on.
                            And to this day, it's unclear where science ends and technology truly starts.</p>

                    <h2>Positive Impact</h2>
                        <p>The advancement of technology has had a profound impact on society, bringing about numerous positive changes. 
                        One of the most significant impacts is improved communication and connectivity. With the rise of the internet, social media,
                        and mobile devices, people can now easily connect and communicate with each other from anywhere in the world. This has helped 
                        to break down barriers, bring people closer together, and foster a greater sense of community.<br>
                
                        Another positive impact of technology is increased access to information and education. The internet provides a wealth of knowledge 
                        and resources at our fingertips, allowing people to learn and grow in ways that were previously not possible. This has led to a democratization 
                        of information and knowledge, enabling people from all walks of life to have equal opportunities to learn and develop new skills.<br>
                
                        Overall, the positive impacts of technology are numerous and far-reaching, helping to transform society and improve people's lives in countless ways.

                    <h2>Negative Impact</h2>
                        <p>The advancement of technology has brought about many positive changes, but it has also had a number of negative impacts on society. One of the most
                            significant negative impacts is the increased screen time and decreased face-to-face interaction. With the rise of digital devices and social media,
                        people are spending more and more time in front of screens, which has led to a decline in face-to-face interaction and real-life social connections.<br>

                        Another negative impact of technology is the rise of cybercrime and online privacy concerns. The internet has made it easier for cybercriminals to access
                            personal information and steal sensitive data, leading to increased instances of identity theft, fraud, and other crimes. At the same time, the increased
                            use of technology has raised concerns about online privacy, as people's personal data is collected, analyzed, and shared by companies and government agencies.<br>

                            Overall, the negative impacts of technology are serious and far-reaching, and it is important for individuals, companies, and governments to work together to
                            mitigate these impacts and promote responsible technology use.</p>

                    <h2>Impact of technology while selling Bonsai plants</h2>
                    <p>Technology has had a tremendous help and influence on our online bonsai plant sales.It has helped in promoting our business online through social medias and the 
                        website is a great boon for bonsai plant vendors like us as we are able to reach a wider audience. Buying and selling of plants with the help of the technology has been so much easier, all thanks to the 
                        technology. Digital marketing tools can be used to reach potential customers and increase visibility. Live Chats and virtual tours can be used as well to engage with customers and provide them information
                        they need to make a purchase. Also, online marketplaces has increased competition in the global market and reduced the profit margins for bonsai plant sellers like us.Shipping live plants is difficult as it 
                        requires proper packaging to ensure that the plants arrive in good condition to the customers.
